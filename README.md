# worldBuildersWiki

## Introduction
#### Problem Statement
You may be a writer, game-maker, dungeon master or just an artist with a lot of ideas, which is wonderful. But all those ideas can become overwhelming when they become too much. When trying to build an entire world with different sorts of items, characters, races, regions, cultures, simply keeping it all in an extremely long google document is not very useful or even comprehensive at times.

#### Solution
Worldbuilder's Wiki helps keep all those ideas in one organized and easily accesible place, much like a regular wiki, fandom wiki or game wiki. A user would be able to create multiple wikis for seperate ideas or projects, and have some customizable control on the layout of each wiki.

## Technologies
1. Swift 5 / Xcode 11.3
1.

## Example of User Usage
- The User is a creator who is presented with the option to create or delete entire wikis.

  - Attempting to add a wiki will prompt a Wiki Edit Mode with a list of wiki pages which they could then add to and delete from.
  
  - The User can also dive deeper within pages to also modify the sections for each page, and the sub-sections for those as well.
  
  - The User will be able to save at each step and when finished is able to view their wiki from the home screen.
  
  - Within each wiki will be a general page that the user can add general overview info of their entire world or project.
  
  - A hamburger menu will show all pages accessable from the general page which a user can then navigate through.
